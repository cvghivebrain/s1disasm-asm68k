Sonic the Hedgehog (Mega Drive) Disassembly
===========================================

Alternate version of the [2022 disassembly](https://github.com/cvghivebrain/s1disasm) using the original asm68k. All [axm68k](https://github.com/cvghivebrain/axm68k) features (i.e. the Z80 macros) have been removed.

Should work with [clownassembler](https://github.com/Clownacy/clownassembler) when it supports all of asm68k's features.
